My Projects
===========

* [kinectable_pipe](http://marshally.github.com/kinectable_pipe/) - a command line utility to dump Microsoft Kinect output to STDOUT, so that it can be easily consumed by scripting libraries.
* [Homebrew based installer for Kinect drivers](https://github.com/marshally/homebrew-alt)
* [rspec-rails-uncommitted](https://github.com/marshally/rspec-rails-uncommitted)
* [rack-modernizr](https://github.com/marshally/rack-modernizr) - My first ruby gem and my first Rack Middleware. Dynamically inserts the modernizr javascript capabilities detection framework into HTML documents, and then makes that available through the Rack environment variables. I haven't used this framework on a recent project, so it hasn't been updated in a while.
